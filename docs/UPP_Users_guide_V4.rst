was performed by Tricia Slovacek and Kate Fossell (NCAR/RAL/DTC).*

NCEP Unified Post Processor (UPP)
=================================

UPP Introduction
================

The NCEP Unified Post Processor has replaced the WRF Post Processor
(WPP). The UPP software package is based on WPP but has enhanced
capabilities to post-process output from a variety of NWP models,
including WRF-NMM, WRF-ARW, Nonhydrostatic Multi-scale Model on the B
grid (NMMB), Global Forecast System (GFS), Climate Forecast System
(CFS), and the global Finite-Volume Cubed Sphere dynamical core (FV3).
At this time, community user support is only provided for the WRF-ARW
and FV3 systems.

In addition to the option to output fields on the models native vertical
levels, UPP interpolates output from the models native grids to National
Weather Service (NWS) standard levels (pressure, height, etc.) and
standard output grids (AWIPS, Lambert Conformal, polar-stereographic,
etc.) in NWS and World Meteorological Organization (WMO) GRIB format.

UPP incorporates the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation
(JCSDA) Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) to compute model
derived brightness temperature (TB) for various instruments and
channels. This additional feature enables the generation of a number of
simulated satellite products including GOES and AMSRE products for
WRF-NMM, Hurricane WRF (HWRF), WRF-ARW and GFS. For CRTM documentation,
refer to:

http://www.dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/user_guide/crtm_ug/CRTM_User_Guide.pdf.

Software Installation/Getting Started
=====================================

UPP Software Requirements
-------------------------

The Community Unified Post Processor version 4 no longer requires users
to first build the WRF model. The WRF I/O libraries that UPP uses are
now included in the UPP build.

Before installing the UPP code, it is necessary to ensure that you have
the required libraries available on your system. These libraries
include:

-  Unidata’s NetCDF library

   https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html

-  The JasPer, PNG, and Zlib libraries, required with the release of
   UPPv2.0 and higher, due to the addition of GRIB2 capabilities. NCEP
   provides these necessary codes for download:

   http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/GRIB2/

-  GNU M4 for UPPV4.0 only, which is used to build the WRF I/O libraries
   now included in UPPV4.0. This is usually bundled with an operating
   system or can be downloaded:

   https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

The UPP has some sample visualization scripts included to create graphics using:

-  GrADS (http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/gadoc.php)

-  GEMPAK (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/index.html)

**Note:** *These are not part of the UPP installation and need to be
installed separately if one would like to use either plotting package.*

UPP has been tested on LINUX platforms (with PGI, Intel and GFORTRAN
compilers).

Obtaining the UPP Code
----------------------

The UPP package can be downloaded from:

http://www.dtcenter.org/upp/users/downloads/index.php

**Note:** *Always obtain the latest version of the code if you
are not trying to continue a pre-existing project.*

Once the *tar* file is obtained, *gunzip* and *untar* the file.

*tar zxvf UPPV4.0.tar.gz*

This command will create a directory called **UPPV4.0**.

UPP Directory Structure
-----------------------

Under the main directory of **UPPV4.0** reside seven subdirectories
(\* indicates directories that are created after the configuration
step):

**arch**: Machine dependent configuration build scripts used to
construct *configure.upp*

**bin**\*: Location of executables after compilation.

**scripts**: contains sample running scripts to process *wrfout* and
*fv3* history files.

-  **run\_unipost**: run *unipost*.

**include**\*: Source include modules built/used during compilation of
UPP

**lib**\*: Archived libraries built/used by UPP

**parm**: Contains the parameter files, which can be modified by the
user to control how the post processing is performed.

**src**: Contains source codes for:

-  **copygb**: Source code for *copygb*

-  **ndate**: Source code for *ndate*

-  **unipost**: Source code for *unipost*

-  **lib**: Contains source code subdirectories for the UPP libraries

   -  **bacio**: Binary I/O library

   -  **crtm2**: Community Radiative Transfer Model library

   -  **g2**: GRIB2 support library

   -  **g2tmpl**: GRIB2 table support library

   -  **gfsio**: GFS I/O routines

   -  **ip**: General interpolation library (see *lib/ip/iplib.doc*)

   -  **nemsio**: NEMS I/O routines

   -  **sfcio**: API for performing I/O on the surface restart file of
      the global spectral model

   -  **sigio**: API for performing I/O on the sigma restart file of the
      global spectral model

   -  **sp**: Spectral transform library (see lib/sp/splib.doc)

   -  **w3emc**: Library for coding and decoding data in GRIB1 format

   -  **w3nco**: Library for coding and decoding data in GRIB1 format

   -  **wrf\_io**: Library containing WRF I/O and netCDF interface code

   -  **wrfmpi\_stubs**: Contains some *C* and *FORTRAN* codes
      to generate *libmpi.a* library used to replace MPI calls for
      serial compilation.

   -  **xmlparse**: XML support GRIB2 parameter file

Installing the UPP Code
-----------------------

UPP uses a build mechanism similar to that used by the WRF model. An
environment variable to a compatible version of netCDF must be set
before beginning the installation.

To reference the netCDF libraries, the configure script checks for an
environment variable (*NETCDF*) first, then the system default
(*/user/local/netcdf*), and then a user supplied link
(*./netcdf\_links*). If none of these resolve a path, the user will
be prompted by the configure script to supply a path.

Type configure, and provide the required info. For example:

*./configure*

You will be given a list of choices for your computer.

1. Linux x86\_64, PGI compiler (serial)

2. Linux x86\_64, PGI compiler (dmpar)

3. Linux x86\_64, Intel compiler (serial)

4. Linux x86\_64, Intel compiler (dmpar)

5. Linux x86\_64, Intel compiler, SGI MPT (serial)

6. Linux x86\_64, Intel compiler, SGI MPT (dmpar)

7. Linux x86\_64, gfortran compiler (serial)

8. Linux x86\_64, gfortran compiler (dmpar)

Choose one of the configure options listed. Check the
*configure.upp* file created and edit for compile options/paths, if
necessary. For debug flag settings, the configure script can be run with
a d switch or flag.

To compile UPP, enter the following command:

*./compile >& compile\_upp.log &*

When compiling with distributed memory (serial) this command should
create 14 (15) UPP libraries in *UPPV3.2/lib/* (*libbacio.a*,
*libCRTM.a*, *libg2.a*, *libg2tmpl.a*, *libgfsio.a*,
*libip.a*, (*libmpi.a*), *libnemsio.a*, *libsfcio.a*,
*libsigio.a*, *libsp.a*, *libw3emc.a*, *libw3nco.a*,
*libwrfio\_nf.a*, *libxmlparse.a*) and three UPP executables in
**bin/** (*unipost.exe*, *ndate.exe*, and *copygb.exe*).

To remove all built files, as well as the *configure.upp*, type:

*./clean*

This action is recommended if a mistake is made during the installation
process or a change is made to the configuration or build environment.
There is also a *clean -a* option which will revert back to a
pre-install configuration.

UPP Functionalities
-------------------

The UPP,

-  is compatible with WRF v3.7 and higher for Ferrier physics (UPPV3.0+)
   or WRF v3.5 and higer (UPPV2.1).

-  can be used to post-process WRF-ARW, WRF-NMM, NMMB, GFS, CFS, and FV3
   forecasts (community support only provided for WRF-ARW and global FV3
   forecasts).

-  can ingest WRF history files (wrfout\*) in netCDF format.

-  can ingest FV3 history files (dyn\*/phy\* or gfs\*) in binarynemsio
   format.

The UPP is divided into two parts:

#. **Unipost**

   -  Interpolates the forecasts from the models native vertical
      coordinate to NWS standard output levels (e.g., pressure, height)
      and computes mean sea level pressure. If the requested parameter
      is on a models native level, then no vertical interpolation is
      performed.

   -  Computes diagnostic output quantities (e.g., convective available
      potential energy, helicity, relative humidity). A full list of
      fields that can be generated by *unipost* is provided for
      https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB1_Table.pdf and
      https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB2_Table.pdf.

   -  Outputs the results in NWS and WMO standard GRIB1 or GRIB2 format
      (for GRIB documentation, see
      http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/).

      -  FV3 only available for GRIB2 output.

   -  Destaggers the WRF-ARW forecasts from a C-grid to an A-grid.

   -  Except for new capabilities of post processing GFS/CFS and
      additions of many new variables, UPP uses the same algorithms to
      derive most existing variables as were used in WPP. The only three
      exceptions/changes from the WPP are:

      -  Computes RH w.r.t. ice for GFS, but w.r.t. water for all other
         supported models. WPP computed RH w.r.t. water only.

      -  The height and wind speed at the maximum wind level is computed
         by assuming the wind speed varies quadratically in height in
         the location of the maximum wind level. The WPP defined maximum
         wind level at the level with the maximum wind speed among all
         model levels. The static tropopause level is obtained by
         finding the lowest level that has a temperature lapse rate of
         less than 2 K/km over a 2 km depth above it. The WPP defined
         the tropopause by finding the lowest level that has a mean UPP
         V3: Users Guide 8 temperature lapse rate of 2 K/km over three
         model layers.

#. **Copygb**

   -  Interpolates the forecasts horizontally from their native grid to
      a standard AWIPS or user-defined grid (for information on AWIPS
      grids, see
      http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/tableb.html).

   -  Outputs the results in NWS and WMO standard GRIB1 format (for GRIB
      documentation, see http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/).

   **Note** *: Copygb only works with GRIB1 format; for GRIB2, use
   wgrib2. (for downloading the source code and information on compiling
   on your system, see:*

In addition to *unipost* and *copygb*, a utility called
*ndate* is distributed with the UPP tarfile. This utility is used to
format the dates of the forecasts to be posted for ingestion by the
codes.

Setting up the WRF or FV3 model to interface with UPP
-----------------------------------------------------

The unipost program is currently set up to read a large number of fields
from the WRF and FV3 model history files. This configuration stems from
NCEP’s need to generate all of its required operational products. When
using the netCDF or NEMS binary read, this program is configured such
that it will run successfully even if an expected input field is missing
from the WRF or FV3 history file as long as this field is not required
to produce a requested output field. If the pre-requisites for a
requested output field are missing from the WRF or FV3 history file,
unipost will abort at run time.

Take care not to remove fields from the wrfout or gfs files, which may
be needed for diagnostic purposes by the UPP package. For example, if
isobaric state fields are requested, but the pressure fields on model
interfaces (i.e. P\_HYD for WRF-ARW) are not available in the history
file, unipost will abort at run time. In general, the default fields
available in the wrfout or gfs files are sufficient to run UPP. The
fields written to the WRF history file are controlled by the settings in
the Registry . For WRF, see the Registry.EM, Registry.EM\_COMMON files
in the Registry subdirectory of the main WRFV4 directory.

**Note**

UPP is written to process a single forecast hour, therefore, having a
single forecast per output file is optimal. However, for WRF based
forecasts, UPP can be run across multiple forecast times in a single
output file to extract a specified forecast hour.

UPP Control File Overview
=========================

GRIB1 control file
------------------

**Note**

The user interacts with unipost through the control file,
*parm/wrf\_cntrl.parm* for WRF runs.

The control file is composed of a header and a body. The header
specifies the output file information. The body allows the user to
select which fields and levels to process.

The header of the ***wrf\_cntrl.parm*** file contains the following
variables:

-  **KGTYPE**: defines output grid type, which should always be 255.

-  **IMDLTY**: identifies the process ID for AWIPS.

-  **DATSET**: defines the prefix used for the output file name.
   Currently set to WRFPRS. Note: the run\_\* scripts assume WRFPRS is
   used for WRF runs.

The body of the *wrf\_cntrl.parm* file is composed of a series of
line pairs similar to the following:

(PRESS ON MDL SFCS ) SCAL=( 3.0)

L=(11000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000
00000 00000 00000)

where,

-  The top line specifies the variable (e.g. PRESS) to process, the
   level type (e.g. ON MDL SFCS) a user is interested in, and the degree
   of accuracy to be retained (SCAL=3.0) in the GRIB output.

   -  SCAL defines the precision of the data written out to the GRIB
      format. Positive values denote decimal scaling (maintain that
      number of significant digits), while negative values describe
      binary scaling (precise to 2^{SCAL}; i.e., SCAL=-3.0 gives output
      precise to the nearest 1/8). Because **copygb** is unable to
      handle binary precision at this time, negative numbers are
      discouraged.

   -  A list of all possible output fields for **unipost** is provided
      in the GRIB1 output table
      https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB1_Table.pdf.
      This table provides the full name of the variable in the first
      column and an abbreviated name in the second column. The
      abbreviated names are used in the control file. Note that the
      variable names also contain the type of level on which they are
      output. For instance, temperature is available on model surface
      and pressure surface.

-  The second line specifies the levels on which the variable is to be
   posted. In this case, 0 indicates no output at this level and 1
   indicates output the variable specified on the top line at the level
   specified by the position of the digit and the type of level defined
   for this variable. For flight/wind energy fields, a 2 may be
   specified, such that 2 requests AGL and 1 requests MSL.

Controlling which variables unipost outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To output a field, the body of the control file needs to contain an
entry for the appropriate variable and output for this variable must be
turned on for at least one level (see next section: *Controlling which
levels unipost outputs*). If an entry for a particular field is not yet
available in the control file, two lines may be added to the control
file with the appropriate entries for that field.

Controlling which levels unipost outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second line of each pair determines which levels unipost will
output. Output on a given level is turned off by a 0 or turned on by a
1.

-  For isobaric output, 46 levels are possible, from 2 to 1000 hPa (*2,
   5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70 mb and then every 25 mb from 75 to 1000
   mb*). The complete list of levels is specified in
   *src/unipost/CTLBLK.f*.

   -  Modify specification of variable LSMDEF to change the number of
      pressure levels: LSMDEF=47

   -  Modify specification of SPLDEF array to change the values of
      pressure levels: (/200.,500.,700.,1000.,2000.,3000.
      &,5000.,7000.,7500.,10000.,12500.,15000.,17500.,20000., …/)

-  For model-level output, all model levels are possible, from the
   highest to the lowest.

-  When using the Noah LSM, the soil layers are 0-10 cm, 10-40 cm,
   40-100 cm, and 100-200 cm.

-  When using the RUC LSM, the soil levels are 0 cm, 1 cm, 4 cm, 10 cm,
   30 cm, 60 cm, 100 cm, 160 cm, and 300 cm. For the RUC LSM, it is also
   necessary to turn on five additional output levels in the
   *wrf\_cntrl.parm* to output 9 instead of 4. (For the old RUC LSM,
   there are only 6 layers and if using this, you will need to change
   “RUC LSM” from 9 to 6 in the WRFPOST.f routine.)

-  When using Pliem-Xiu LSM, there are two layers: 0-1 cm, 1-100 cm

-  For low, mid, and high cloud layers, the layers are :math:`\geq`\ 642
   hPa, :math:`\geq`\ 350 hPa, and <350 hPa, respectively.

-  For PBL layer averages, the levels correspond to 6 layers with a
   thickness of 30 hPa each.

-  For flight level, the levels are 30 m, 50 m, 80 m, 100 m, 305 m, 457
   m, 610 m, 914 m, 1524 m, 1829 m, 2134 m, 2743 m, 3658 m, 4572 m, 6000
   m, 7010 m.

-  For AGL radar reflectivity, the levels are 4000 and 1000 m (see
   Appendix A for details).

-  For surface or shelter-level output, only the first position of the
   line needs to be turned on.

   -  For example, the sample control file *parm/wrf\_cntrl.parm*
      has the following entry for surface dew point temperature:

      (SURFACE DEWPOINT ) SCAL=( 4.0)

      L=(00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000
      00000 00000 00000 00000)

      Based on this entry, surface dew point temperature will not be
      output by unipost. To add this field to the output, modify the
      entry to read:

      (SURFACE DEWPOINT ) SCAL=( 4.0)

      L=(10000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000
      00000 00000 00000 00000)

GRIB2 control file
------------------

**Note** *: This section describes the control file for outputting
GRIB2 format.*

Version 3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The xml file **parm/postcntrl.xml** replaces the **wrf\_cntrl.parm**
   file to declare which fields you want to output from UPP. The samples
   in **parm/wrfcnrtl.xml** are not exhaustive at this time and is
   provided as a template only. Note that it will require edits by the
   user to expand beyond the basic testing setup.

-  A list of available GRIB2 fields is in **parm/post\_avblflds.xml**.
   UPP uses this file to define certain field parameters. Users may look
   in this file to view a full list of available GRIB2 fields. Again, as
   new fields are added or modified they will be provided.

-  To run grib2, copy a xml template to be named *postcntrl.xml* in
   the *DOMAINPATH/parm/* directory as outlined below. Edit the xml
   file as needed.

Version 3.1 and Onward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  For outputting GRIB2 format using version 3.1, a preprocessing step
   is required by the user to convert the xml file
   *parm/postcntrl.xml* to a flat text file
   *postxconfig-NT.txt*. This new flat file is quicker to process
   than the old xml file. The user will still need to edit the
   *postcntrl.xml* file to declare which fields are to be output
   from UPP.

-  In order to ensure that the user-edited xml files are error free, XML
   stylesheets (*parm/EMC\_POST\_CTRL\_Schema.xsd* and
   *EMC\_POST\_Avblflds\_Schema.xsd*) are used to validate both the
   *postcntrl.xml* and *post\_avblflds.xml* files, respectively.
   Confirmation of validation will be given (e.g. postcntrl.xml
   validates) or otherwise return errors if it does not match the
   schema. To run the validation:

   *xmllint --noout --schema EMC\_POST\_CTRL\_Schema.xsd
   postcntrl.xml*

   *xmllint --noout --schema EMC\_POST\_Avblflds\_Schema.xsd
   post\_avblflds.xml*

-  Once the xmls are validated, the user will need to generate the flat
   file. Edit the *parm/makefile* if necessary to point to the
   correct flat file directory and xmls. The makefile will call the perl
   program *parm/POSTXMLPreprocessor.pl* to generate the post flat
   file *postxconfig-NT.txt*. Generate the flat file:

   *make*

   **Note**\ *: The new flat file can only be used for running version
   3.1 and onward and is not backwards compatible with version 3.0.*

Running UPP
===========

Seven scripts for running the UPP package are included in the tar file:

**run\_unipost**

**run\_unipostandgrads**

**run\_unipostandgempak**

**run\_unipost\_frames**

**run\_unipost\_gracet**

**run\_unipost\_minute**

**run\_unipostandgrads\_global**

#. *cd* to your *DOMAINPATH* directory.

#. Make a directory to put the UPP results.

   *mkdir postprd*

#. Make a directory to put a copy of *wrf\_cntrl.parm* file if
   running grib1. If running grib2 copy *postcntrl.xml* for v3.0 or
   *postxconfig-NT.txt* for v3.1+.

   *mkdir parm*

#. Copy over the relevant control file to your working directory to
   customize *unipost*

   For Grib1, copy the default *UPPV4.0/parm/wrf\_cntrl.parm* file.

   For Grib2, copy a template *UPPV3.0/parm/wrfcntrl.xml* if using
   v3.0 or *UPPV4.0/parm/postxconfig-NT-WRF.txt* if using v3.1+. For
   v4.0, a template *UPPV4.0/parm/postxconfig-NT-GFS.txt* **for FV3
   can be used.**

#. Edit the *wrf\_cntrl.parm* file to reflect the fields and levels
   you want unipost to output. (For Grib2: Edit the *postcntrl.xml*
   file for v3.0 or the *postxconfigNT.txt* file for v3.1+)

#. Copy over the (*UPPV4.0/scripts/run\_unipost*\*) script of your
   choice to the *postprd/*.

#. Edit the run script as outlined below. Once these directories are set
   up and the edits outlined below are complete, the scripts can be run
   interactively from the *postprd* directory by simply typing the
   script name on the command line.

Overview of the scripts to run the UPP
--------------------------------------

**Note** *: It is recommended that the user refer to the
run\_unipost scripts in the script*

Since V3.0, user modified variables are now all contained at the top of
the *run\_unipost* script in one user-edit section, along with a
brief description. Descriptions below follow the *run\_unipost*
script.

#. Set up basic path variables:

   **TOP\_DIR** : Top level directory for source code (*UPPV4.0*)

   **DOMAINPATH** : Working directory for this run

   **UNIPOST\_HOME** : Location of the *UPPV4.0* build directory

   **POSTEXEC** : Location of the *UPPV4.0* executables

   **modelDataPath** : Location of the model output data files to be
   processed (e.g. *wrfprd/* for WRF-based runs).

   **paramFile** : Name and location of cntrl.parm
   (*wrf\_cntrl.parm*) text file that lists desired fields for GRIB1
   output. Template in *UPPV4.0/parm/*

   **txtCntrlFile** : Name and location of *postxconfig-NT.txt*
   file that lists desired fields for GRIB2 format for version 3.1+.
   This file is generated by the user following the steps listed above
   in the GRIB2 Control File section.

   **Note** *: For WRF, the scripts are configured such that
   unipost expects the WRF history files (wrfout
   files) to be in wrfprd/, the wrf\_cntrl.parm
   (postcntrl.xml or postxconfig-NT.txt) file to be
   in parm/ and the postprocessor working directory to be
   called postprd/, all under DOMAINPATH*

   This set up is for user convenience to have a script ready to run,
   paths may be modified but be sure to check the run script to make
   sure settings are correct.

#. Specify dynamic core being run (ARW or FV3)

   **dyncore** : What model core is used (ARW or FV3)

#. Specify the format for the input model files and output UPP files.

   **inFormat** : Format of the model data

   arw netcdf

   fv3 binarynemsio

   **outFormat** : Format of output from UPP

   grib

   grib2

#. Specify the forecast cycles to be post-processed

   **startdate** : Forecast start date (YYYYMMDDHH)

   **fhr** : First forecast hour to be post-processed

   **lastfhr** : Last forecast hour to be post-processed

   **incrementhr** : Increment (in hours) between forecast files

   Do not set to 0 or the script will loop continuously

#. Set up how many domains will be post-processed

   **domain\_list** : List of domains for run (e.g. d01 d02)

#. Set/uncomment the run command for your system. (i.e. serial, mpirun,
   etc).

   **RUN\_COMMAND** : System run command for serial or parallel runs

   -  The default execution command in the distributed scripts is for a
      single processor:

      *./unipost.exe > unipost\_${domain}.${fhr}.out 2>&1*

   -  To run unipost using mpi (dmpar compilation), the command line
      should be:

      >> LINUX-MPI systems: *mpirun -np N unipost.exe > outpost
      2>&1*

      (**Note** *: on some systems a host file also needs to be
      specified: machinefile host*)

      >> IBM: *mpirun.lsf unipost.exe < itag > outpost*

      >> SGI MPT: *mpiexec\_mpt*

#. Set copygb grid definitions (optional - uncomment copygb section in
   script to run)

   -  copygb\_opt : Copygb grid option to regrid

      awips = Use a predefined awips grid, e.g. 212 \*\* Uncomment
      export awips\_id= and add desired grid number.

      custom = Specify your own grid \*\* Uncomment export custom\_gds=
      and add grid description.

   **Note** *: More information about copygb is provided
   below under Examples of copygb. Copygb runs on
   GRIB1 format only. For GRIB2 format, wgrib2 is required, with
   more information provided below under "Examples of wgrib2"*

#. Set naming convention for prefix and extension of output file name

   -  **comsp** is the initial string of the output file name (by
      default it is not set and the prefix of the output file will be
      the string set in *wrf\_cntrl.parm DATSET*, if set it
      will concatenate the setting to the front of the string specified
      in *wrf\_cntrl.parm DATSET*

   -  **tmmark** is used for the file extension (in
      *run\_unipost*, *tmmark=tm00*, if not set, it is set to .GrbF)

Since V3.0, the itag that will be read in by *unipost.exe* from
stdin (unit 5) is generated automatically in the *run\_unipost*
script based on the user-defined options above. It should not be
necessary to edit this. For description purposes, the namelist
(*itag*) contains 5 (6) lines for WRF (FV3):

#. Name of the WRF or FV3 (pressure level) output file to be posted.

#. Format of WRF or FV3 model output (netcdf, binarynemsio).

#. Format of UPP output (GRIB1 or GRIB2)

#. Forecast valid time (not model start time) in WRF or FV3 format (the
   forecast time desired to be post-processed).

#. Dynamic core used (NCAR or GFS).

#. Name of the FV3 (surface) output file to be post-processed.

**Note:** *If the third line (i.e., UPP output type) is not set, UPP will default the output le format to grib1.
This is only for WRF since UPP output for FV3 only supports GRIB2.*

If scripts *run\_unipostandgrads* or *run\_unipostandgempak* are
used, additional steps are taken to create image files (see
Visualization section below).

Upon a successful run, *unipost* and *copygb* (optional) will
generate output files *WRFPRS\_dnn.hh* (*GFSPRS.hh*) and
*wrfprs\_dnn.hh* (*gfsprs.hh*), respectively, in the
postprocessor working directory, where *nn* refers to the domain id and
*hh* denotes the forecast hour. In addition, the script
*run\_unipostandgrads* will produce a suite of png images named
*variablehh\_GrADS.png*, and the script *run\_unipostandgempak*
will produce a suite of gif images named *variablehh.gif*.

If the run did not complete successfully, a log file in the
post-processor working directory called *unipost\_dnn.hh.out*
(*unipost.hh.out*), where *nn* is the domain id and *hh* is the
forecast hour, may be consulted for further information.

Examples of copygb
==================

Sample command line for calling copygb:

   *copygb.exe -xg"grid [kgds]" input\_file output\_file*

where *grid* refers to the output grid to which the native forecast
is being interpolated.

The output grid can be specified in three ways:

#. As the grid id of a pre-defined AWIPS grid number (gridno):

   *copygb.exe -g${gridno} -x input\_file output\_file

   For example, using grid 218:

   *copygb.exe -xg"218" WRFPRS_$domain.${fhr} wrfprs\_$domain.${fhr}

#. As a user defined standard grid, such as for grid 255:

   *copygb.exe xg"255 kgds" input\_file output\_file*

   where the user defined grid is specified by a full set of kgds
   parameters determining a GRIB GDS (grid description section) in the
   *W3fi63* format. Details on how to specify the kgds parameters
   are documented in file *lib/w3lib/w3fi71.f*. For example:

   *copygb.exe -xg" 255 3 109 91 37719 -77645 8 -71000 10433 9966 0 64 42000 42000"
   WRFPRS\_$domain.${fhr} wrfprs\_$domain.${fhr}*

#. From a file: When WRF-ARW output is processed by *unipost*, a
   text file, *copygb\_hwrf.txt*, is created. This file contain the
   GRID GDS of a lat/lon grid similar in domain and grid spacing to the
   one used to run the WRF-ARW model. The contents of this file can be
   read into the variable “nav” and can be used as input to
   *copygb.exe*.

   *copygb.exe -xg"$nav" input\_file output\_file*

   For example, when using *copygb\_hwrf.txt* for an application,
   the steps include:

   *read nav < ’copygb\_hwrf.txt’*

   *export nav*

   *copygb.exe -xg"${nav}" WRFPRS\_$domain.${fhr}*

   *wrfprs\_$domain.${fhr}*

It should be noted that copygb is a flexible program that can accept
several command line options specifying details of how the horizontal
interpolation from the native grid to the output grid should be
performed. Complete documentation of copygb can be found at:

http://www.dtcenter.org/met/users/support/online_tutorial/METv5.0/copygb/copygb.txt

Examples of wgrib2
==================

*Wgrib2* is a versatile program that has the ability to convert
grib2 files from one grid to another for various user-defined grids as
well as pre-defined NCEP grids. Complete documentation with examples of
re-gridding for all available grid definitions can be found at:

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/new_grid.html.

Sample command line usage for calling wgrib2:

   *wgrib2 -new\_grid\_winds W -new\_grid A B C outfile*

Where,

**W** = earth or grid

  earth: winds oriented to the earths north and south directions

  grid: winds are rotated so that north is relative to the grid

**A**, **B**, and **C** represent the output grid description

Sample lat-lon grid description:

**A** = latlon

**B** = lon0:nlon:dlon

  lon0 is longitude of first grid point in degrees

  nlon is number of longitudes

  dlon is grid resolution in degrees of longitude

**C** = lat0:nlat:dlat

  lat0 is latitude of first grid point

  nlat is number of latitudes

  dlat is grid resolution in degrees of latitude

**Note:** *At this time, wgrib2 is not distributed within the UPP tar
file. Users may download and install from
http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/.*

Visualization with UPP
======================

GEMPAK 
-------

The GEMPAK utility *nagrib* is able to decode GRIB files whose
navigation is on any non-staggered grid. Hence, GEMPAK is able to decode
GRIB files generated by the UPP package and plot horizontal fields or
vertical cross sections.

A sample script named *run\_unipostandgempak*, which is included in
the scripts directory of the tar file, can be used to run *unipost*,
*copygb*, and plot the following fields using GEMPAK:

-  **Sfcmap\_dnn\_hh.gif**: mean SLP and 6 hourly precipitation

-  **PrecipType\_dnn\_hh.gif**: precipitation type (just snow and
   rain)

-  **850mbRH\_dnn\_hh.gif**: 850 mb relative humidity

-  **850mbTempandWind\_dnn\_hh.gif**: 850 mb temperature and wind
   vectors

-  **500mbHandVort\_dnn\_hh.gif**: 500 mb geopotential height and
   vorticity

-  **250mbWindandH\_dnn\_hh.gif**: 250 mb wind speed isotacs and
   geopotential height

This script can be modified to customize fields for output. GEMPAK has
an online users guide at:

http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/gempak/help_and_documentation/manual/.

In order to use the script *run\_unipostandgempak*, it is necessary
to set the environment variable *GEMEXEC* to the path of the GEMPAK
executables. For example,

   *setenv GEMEXEC /usr/local/gempak/bin*

GrADS
-----

The GrADS utilities *grib2ctl.pl* (*g2ctl.pl*) and *gribmap*
are able to decode GRIB1 (GRIB2) files whose navigation is on any
non-staggered grid. These utilities and instructions on how to use them
to generate GrADS control files are available from:

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/grib2ctl.html (GRIB1)

http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/g2ctl.html (GRIB2).

The GrADS package is available from:
http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/gadoc.php.

GrADS has an online Users Guide at:
http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/users.html

A list of basic commands for GrADS can be found at:
http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/reference_card.pdf.

A sample script named *run\_unipostandgrads*, which is included in
the scripts directory of the Unified Post Processing package, can be
used to run *unipost*, *copygb*, and plot the following fields
using GrADS:

-  **Sfcmaphh\_dnn\_GRADS.png**: mean SLP and 6-hour accumulated
   precipitation.

-  **850mbRHhh\_dnn\_GRADS.png**: 850 mb relative humidity

-  **850mbTempandWindhh\_dnn\_GRADS.png**: 850 mb temperature and wind
   vectors

-  **500mbHandVorthh\_dnn\_GRADS.png**: 500 mb geopotential heights
   and absolute vorticity

-  **250mbWindandHhh\_dnn\_GRADS.png**: 250 mb wind speed isotacs and
   geopotential heights

In order to use the script *run\_unipostandgrads*, it is necessary
to:

#. Set the environmental variable GADDIR to the path of the GrADS fonts
   and auxiliary files. For example:

   *setenv GADDIR /usr/local/grads/data*

#. Add the location of the GrADS executables to the PATH. For example:

   *setenv PATH /usr/local/grads/bin:$PATH*

#. Link script *cbar.gs* to the post-processor working directory.
   (This scripts is provided in UPP package, and the
   *run\_unipostandgrads* script makes a link from *scripts/* to
   *postprd/*.) To generate the plots above, GrADS script
   *cbar.gs* is invoked. This script can also be obtained from the
   GrADS library of scripts at
   http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/gadoc/library.html.

Fields produced by unipost
==========================

The 3 tables described below contain documentation regarding the fields
that are available for output by UPP for both GRIB1 and GRIB2.

Grib1 Table:
------------

https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB1_Table.pdf

This table lists basic and derived fields currently produced by unipost
for grib1. The abbreviated names listed in the second column of each
table describe how the fields should be entered in the
*wrf\_cntrl.parm*.

Grib2 Table:
------------

https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB2_Table.pdf

This table lists basic and derived fields currently produced by unipost
for grib2. The abbreviated names listed in the second column of each
table describe how the fields should be entered in the
*post\_cntrl.xml*.

Grib2 Table (Extended):
-----------------------

https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/docs/tables/UPP_GRIB2_Extended_Table.pdf

This table lists basic and derived fields currently produced by
*unipost* for grib2 and includes the parameter information which UPP
uses for identifying fields for GRIB2.

Appendix A: UPPV3.1+ Reflectivity field descriptions
====================================================

Reflectivities are filled/computed depending on the model core and
microphysics options.

UPP uses model derived reflectivity (REFL\_10CM from WRF) for model runs
using the Thompson microphysics option (mp=8). Other combinations use
algorithms within UPP code.

Work is underway to provide more user flexibility when selecting
reflectivity computations. For more information on model computed
reflectivity, e.g. REFL\_10CM, please see model documentation.

Relevant routines for reflectivity. Some or all of these may need to be
modified if the user desires to change where/how reflectivity is
processed. It is recommended that the user have knowledge of the model
output and reflectivity computations before trying to modify the UPP
code. Email `upp-help@ucar.edu <mailto:>`__ for further questions.

**INITPOST**\* - Separate routines for each different model core (e.g.
ARW, FV3, etc.). Reads model fields, e.g. REFL\_10CM, REFD\_MAX

**MDLFLD.f** - Computes DBZ or fills DBZ arrays with model computed
Reflectivity. - Fills 3-D model level reflectivity array (UPP ID: 250) -
Fills 2-D composite reflectivity array (UPP ID: 252)

**MDL2AGL.f** - Interpolates relevant DBZ array to AGL reflectivity
(UPP ID: 253) - Outputs model computed maximum hourly reflectivity
(REFD\_MAX; UPP ID: 421)

**MDL2P.f** - Interpolates relevant DBZ array to pressure levels (UPP
ID: 251)

Appendix B: Adding a new variable to the UPP code
=================================================

*This document provides general procedures and an example of how to add
a new variable to the UPP code. Please keep in mind it may not be an
exhaustive step-by-step depending on your particular situation. While we
can provide general assistance for adding a new variable, users should
be aware that this requires good knowledge of Fortran and thorough
understanding of the code.*

*We encourage users to contact us at upp-help@ucar.edu to make us aware
of modifications you are making. In some cases, if we determine the
changes you are making may be relevant for operational and/or community
purposes, we will be interested in incorporating your changes into the
code base for support and future release. We would then work with you to
make this possible.*

****

#. Allocate the field: ALLOCATE.f

   *This file is the instantiation or allocation of the* **variable**

#. Deallocate the field: DEALLOCATE.f

#. Declare the new variable: VRBLS2D\_mod.f, VRBLS3D\_mod.f or
   VRBLS4D\_mod.f

#. Define field for grib1: RQSTFLD.f

#. Read model output: INITPOST.F

#. Determine routine for filling variable: e.g SURFCE.f, MDLFLD.f,
   MDL2P.f, etc.

#. Define table/grib2 parameters/ for grib2 output:
   params\_grib2\_tbl\_new

#. Define the field for grib2 output: post\_avlbflds.xml

#. Define control file entry for output: postcntrl.xml &
   postxconfig-NT.txt

#. Define output control file: wrf\_cntrl.parm

   *This file is used for controlling which fields are output by UPP for
   grib1.*

****

-  This example illustrates a new variable from the WRF output that will
   be read into UPP and directly output into the grib output files (i.e.
   no additional computations/calculations are needed for the field).

-  Note that while grib1 procedures are provided, we have moved to grib2
   almost exclusively. As such support for grib1 additions is limited.

-  Additions to each of the routines are highlighted in ````.

-  Locations of **** are in /UPPV3.2/src/unipost unless specified
   otherwise.

-  A sample wrfout file for the following procedures is available for
   download from:

   -  https://dtcenter.org/upp/users/downloads/data/AddNewVariableData.tar.gz

   -  This data is the 6-hr forecast of a WRF initialization of
      2009-12-17\_12:00:00

   -  Add using the 2D variable **** (snowfall accumulation), which is
      also a 2D surface based accumulation field, as a template by
      following it through the routine.

#. Determine the correct routine to add the new variable to (e.g. ****,
   ****, ****, etc). You will need to determine the correct routine to
   add your field into; this is the place that you will fill the array
   with the data and call gribit to output the field. The correct
   routine will depend on what your field is. For example, if you have a
   new diagnostic called foo, and you want it interpolated to pressure
   levels, you would need to add it to ****. If foo was only a surface
   variable, you would add it to ****. If you wanted foo on native model
   levels, you would add it to ****. If youre not sure which routine to
   add the new variable to, choose a similar variable as a template.

   *Note:* This is also where you would add any calculations needed for
   your new variable, should it be required.

   ****

   -  Treat ACLHF like a surface field (****)

   -  Using the variable **** (accumulated depth of snowfall) as a
      template which is also an accumulated field that is just being
      read through and output, similar to what we want.

   -  Add in top section in use vrbls2d, only to initiate the new
      variable as:

      ````

   -  Add in main section using the template variable as a guide.

      -  Note that ID(02), which is the ID for table version number, is
         added and set to 130. This is the table that we are adding the
         new variable to.

      -  The block of code in ```` is for metadata for the accumulation
         field being added in this example and the user does not need to
         edit it and it is not always needed. For example, for an
         instantaneous field, you would not need that block.

   the wgrib utility if available on your system).

   -  The new variable will not be defined by the variable name. Instead
      it is defined by ```` (grib1 ID) and ```` (level type) you gave it
      in **** in step 4.

   -  For this particular variable, the accumulation period is shown,
      due to the addition of the metadata block in the **** routine.
